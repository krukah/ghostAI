The game Ghost is a spelling game that can be played with two or more players.  The rules are as follows.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of the game is for all players to collectively spell an English word, one letter at a time, with each individual player trying to avoid apelling the last letter of any word.  Essentially, every player is aiming to continue a valid word from the letters played before it without finishing the word himself.  Proper nouns, hyphenated words, and words with spaces are not permitted, and words that are 3 letters or shorter are exempt.  A player who finishes a word receives a strike, and a player who accumulates 5 strikes is eliminated from the game.
