# G-H-O-S-T

The game Ghost is a spelling game that can be played with two or more players.  The rules are as follows.

OBJECTIVE:

GHOST can be thought of as linguistic hot potato: each player takes turns spelling a word one letter at a time while trying to avoid completing any word by spelling the last letter and forcing others to do so. Proper nouns, hyphenated words, and words with spaces are not allowed. Words that are 3 letters or shorter are exempt. For example, you would not be penalized for spelling the T in "CAT", but you would for spelling the S in "CATS" even though both are English words.

The penalty for finishing a word is receiving a strike, and any player who accumulates 5 strikes is eliminated from the game. The game continues until there is one standing player who is declared winner.
